            A Scholarly Digital Critical Edition is a conceptually and structurally sophisticated entity, not only because the text is “constrained by its sequential presentation”, but also because it is characterized by a multidimensional complexity. Editions of South Asian texts, in particular, contain a series of phenomena difficult to manage formally, such as the overlapping, which requires establishing the data structure best suited to represent this complexity. The present paper focuses on exploring a case study from the Śivadharma Database, an upcoming digital library of L’Orientale University of Naples, the École française d’Extrême-Orient, and the /DH.arc Research Centre of Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna. The results show that a tree structure is insufficient to handle the non-linearity of the readings of a text in South Asian languages, while the graph database Neo4j, used for a CRUD web application, is a better solution to structure and store data to create, publish, store, catalog, update, visualize, and browse Scholarly Digital Critical Editions.
